Modified distribution of the Adobe Flex SDK Source with code instrumentation for coverage measurement built into the ASC compiler.

See the [flexcover](http://code.google.com/p/flexcover) project for a binary distribution of the actual coverage tool.  This project only contains the modified SDK source code.

See the ProjectStructure page for more information on how this repository is organized.

See the HowFlexcoverWorks page for more information on the actual implementation.
