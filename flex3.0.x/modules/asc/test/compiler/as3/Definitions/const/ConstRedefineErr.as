 *  Running the test
 *
 *  There are three possible environments that these tests should
 *  run in
 *
 *  spidermonkey  - ECMA 3 tests only, should not need to write any
 *                  more than what we have from mozilla.org
 *
 *                  * use shell.as
 *
 *  Flash MX 2004 - existing Actionscript 2.0 environment.  Only tests
 *                  that are supported by Flash 7 will run here
 *
 *                  * use shellMX2004.as
 *
 *  ASC/ASRT      - All tests written must compile and run here
 *
 *                  * use shellASC.as

/**
 * Calls to AddTestCase here. AddTestCase is a function that is defined
 * in shell.js and takes three arguments:
 * - a string representation of what is being tested
 * - the expected result
 * - the actual result
 *
 * For example, a test might look like this:
 *
 * var helloWorld = "Hello World";
 *
 * AddTestCase(
 * "var helloWorld = 'Hello World'",   // description of the test
 *  "Hello World",                     // expected result
 *  helloWorld );                      // actual result
